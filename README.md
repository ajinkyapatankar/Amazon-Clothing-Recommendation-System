# Amazon-Clothing-Recommendation-System
In this project we have built an Amazon Clothing Recommendation System which uses the following models: VGG Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), TF-IDF and Bag of Words to give us the top recommendations of items most similar to the selected item. We are using TF-IDF and Bag of Words on product titles and CNN on images for recommendations. We have taken Women Apparel Data of Amazon from Kaggle.com which is in json format and consists of 183138 data points and 19 features. Out of the 19 features we take into consideration 7 features for recommending items to the user.
